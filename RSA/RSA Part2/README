RSA Part 2 uses the SHA256 libray to encrypt a message into a 256 bit hash code.
Our RSA algorithm passes a private and a public key used to encrypt and decrypt. 

private key = (d, n)
public key = (e, n)

The encrpytion involves using the RSA formula M^d % n, giving us a digital signature to use for sending the message without it being
read without decrypting it with the public key. To decrypt, this requires the public key to be used on the signature.

decrypt = ((M^d %n)^e) % n

The message cannot be read if the message was tampered with in the process of being sent, i.e., the signature was corrupted.
